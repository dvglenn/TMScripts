# [OBPS Helper](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/OBPSHelper.user.js)
### Adds "Add SP00" and "ADD ASIN" buttons to Problem Solve screen.  These are simple shortcuts to remove the requirement to copy/paste the SP00 and ASIN while doing problem solves.

# [Missing Expirations Helper](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/MissingExpirationHelper.user.js)
### Adds "View" Button for each ASIN in the Missing Expirations list.  When this button is clicked, it will open the Inventory tool in a separate window. This eliminates the need to highlight, copy, switch to the inventory page, and paste in the ASIN and replaces it with a single click of the button.

# [Missing Expirations Inventory Helper](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/MissingExpirationInventoryHelper.user.js)
### Used in conjunction with the above "Missing Expirations Helper", when doing Missing Expirations and use the "View" button, it will highlight the first row with that has a missing expiration date and will place the focus in the date box allowing you to immediately type in the new expiration date without having to click into the date text box.
