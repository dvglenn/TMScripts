# [OBPS Helper](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/OBPSHelper.user.js)
### Adds "Add SP00" and "ADD ASIN" buttons to Problem Solve screen.  These are simple shortcuts to remove the requirement to copy/paste the SP00 and ASIN while doing problem solves.

# [Assign Picklist](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/AssignPicklist.user.js)
### Adds Copy All button to bottom of View Picklist screen. When pressed, it copies all of the picklists and opens the Assign Picklist Screen where you can then manually type in an AA's username and then paste the copied picklists to be assigned.

# [Missing Expirations Helper](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/MissingExpirationHelper.user.js)
### Adds "View" Button for each ASIN in the Missing Expirations list.  When this button is clicked, it will open the Inventory tool in a separate window. This eliminates the need to highlight, copy, switch to the inventory page, and paste in the ASIN and replaces it with a single click of the button.

# [Missing Expirations Inventory Helper](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/MissingExpirationInventoryHelper.user.js)
### Used in conjunction with the above "Missing Expirations Helper", when doing Missing Expirations and use the "View" button, it will highlight the first row with that has a missing expiration date and will place the focus in the date box allowing you to immediately type in the new expiration date without having to click into the date text box.

# [Idle Time Focus](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/IdleTimeFocus.user.js)
### Sets the focus to the first dropdown where "Idle" is currently selected.  This alleviates the endless scrolling through all of the records to get to the one you likely need to examine.

# [Picklist Count by user](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/PicklistCountByUser.user.js)

# [Picklist Count by user WITH Rate](https://github.com/dvglenn/TMScripts/raw/main/PicklistCountByUserWithRate.user.js)
### Shows summary of all AA's with a picklist currently assigned to them.  This one also include the AA's rate for the prior hour.  This requires you to be connected to VPN and to use AftLite NA instead of AftLite Portal.  After installing, you can view the summary table via the <a href="https://aftlite-na.amazon.com/picklist_group">Picklist Group</a> page.
